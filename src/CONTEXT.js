I and my team created this website for showcasing the trash spread by people which is manufactured by Private companies like Coca Cola, Pepsi, Lays etc. Users would upload photos of the trash that is spread in public places. The uploaded photos undergo image processing from where we identify the company that manufactured the product. The data collected from these uploads are used to highlight which company has the most trash and in which zone. Users would be given reward coins based on the upload milestones. Using which they can buy NFTS through our website. ",
